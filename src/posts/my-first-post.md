Decided to make a blog to practice making custom WordPress layouts. I’m not sure how much I will actually use this, but I do feel like it benefited my WordPress skills a little bit. I may post about my journey in learning web development, and random code snippets, or random thoughts about web development.

This layout is using a simple BootStrap template that can be found from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zt8va_6HRk&list=PLillGF-RfqbaKe3TWtwDW8vYV2MHIFPEi" target="_blank">Brad Traversy’s WordPress YouTube course </a> which I highly recommend if you want to learn about WordPress or any programming in general, Brad is a great teacher.
